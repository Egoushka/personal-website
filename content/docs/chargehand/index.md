chargehand turns a request into a typed Task Spec, runs it on one or more coding-agent sessions (OpenCode or Claude Code), and returns a result contract with evidence for every claim. People call it from a CLI; programs call it over HTTP or MCP.

## The problem it solves

Coding agents answer in prose. A program that calls one needs something it can check: claims tied to files at a commit, diffs, session messages or caller inputs, plus a confidence and the exact prompt chain behind the answer.

chargehand keeps the control flow in code: the task graph, budgets, retries and parallelism. Each worker's context stays small, cached and disposable.

## How a run works

1. **Intake** reads a `request/v1` document and writes a Task Spec (`task-spec/v1`) with one action.
2. **The action** decides what happens next:
   - `answer` runs one worker session.
   - `split` runs 2 to 4 read-only subtasks as a task graph, at most 2 at a time. Later nodes fork the first node's session and read its prompt prefix from cache. The node results merge without a model call.
   - `deny` stops with status `denied`, a reason and an unblock condition.
   - `ask` stops with status `needs_input` and the questions.
   - `improve` stops with status `needs_input`, an improved request and its diff.

   When the preset does not allow the action intake chose, the run falls back to `answer`. A preset can also stop a run for approval above a risk or cost estimate; among the shipped presets only `strict` does.
3. **The evidence resolver** checks every citation before a result leaves its node. A `file` citation must name a path and a line range that exist at the pinned commit. A `commit` must exist, a `diff` range must fall inside the node's session diff, a `session_message` must belong to the node's session, a `url` must appear in the node's inputs or tool output, and an `input` must be an id the caller sent. The worker gets one repair turn; claims whose citations still fail move to `open_questions`.
4. **You get `result/v1`.** The run log records tokens, cache hits, cost and the prompt chain of every call.

A citation that resolves points at something that exists. chargehand does not yet read the cited lines against the claim: that support check is planned for 0.8 in [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md). This guide says "citations checked" for that reason.

Sources: [README](../../README.md#how-a-run-works), [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-result-contract.md), [ADR 0017](../adr/0017-split-runs-forked-siblings-and-merge.md), [GitEvidenceResolver.cs](../../src/Chargehand/Verification/GitEvidenceResolver.cs).

## What it does not do

- It has no agent loop of its own. The workers are OpenCode or Claude Code sessions.
- It makes no calls to model providers. The worker runtime makes them.
- It does not add parallelism for its own sake. A split runs when intake chooses it and the preset allows it; `default`, `review` and `draft` allow no split.
- Its workers do not write. Every shipped preset is read-only, and a split that includes a writing subtask runs as one answer node.

[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) lists four things as not planned: an agent loop of its own, a model gateway, a memory store and a plugin marketplace.

## Current status

- **Before 1.0.** The latest release is v0.3.0. Goal 0.4 in the roadmap, "it runs with nothing configured", comes next.
- **Read-only workers.** Writing nodes in worktrees belong to goal 0.7.
- **Not on nuget.org.** Neither the `Chargehand` tool package nor `Chargehand.Contracts` is published, so you run chargehand from a clone of the repository. The `dnx` lines in the README and on [the MCP page](mcp.md) work only once the package is published.
- **Main is ahead of the release.** This guide describes the `main` branch. The changes under Unreleased in the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md#unreleased) (optional profile file, runtime selection, unknown cost for unpriced models) are not in a release. Neither are `chargehand mcp`, the Claude Code plugin and the `review` preset, which no section of the changelog lists yet. Pages mark these "on main, not yet released".

## Where to go next

- [What it does, and how we know](capabilities.md): each capability with its status and the evidence behind it.
- [Quickstart](quickstart.md): one question from a checkout, end to end.
- [Use it from an MCP client](mcp.md): the `orchestrate` tool over stdio or HTTP.
- [Run the HTTP server](server.md): `chargehand serve`, its routes and the container image.
- [The change command](change.md): `/chargehand:change` in Claude Code.
- [Prompt CI](prompt-ci.md): how prompt and preset changes get gated.
- [Reference](reference.md): commands, presets, contracts, profile fields, environment variables.
- [Architecture decisions](decisions.md): every ADR and what it decides.
