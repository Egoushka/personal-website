title: "What it does, and how we know"
description: "Each capability with a status of works, partial or not yet, and the test, benchmark, ADR or roadmap entry behind that status."
order: 1
section: "Project"
---

Each row names the evidence for its status. `works` means a test in this repository or a recorded benchmark covers the capability. `partial` means part of it is missing, or nothing in the repository tests or measures it. `not yet` means it is planned and not built.

The tests call no model. They run the orchestrator on a scripted runtime ([ScriptedRuntime.cs](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ScriptedRuntime.cs)) or on stand-in `opencode` and `claude` binaries. The runs against real models are the ones in [docs/benchmarks.md](../benchmarks.md) and the live checks that ADRs record.

## The evidence in full

### Answer a read-only question with citations checked against the pinned commit

- [EvidenceResolverTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/EvidenceResolverTests.cs)
- [WorkerNodeTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/WorkerNodeTests.cs) (one repair turn, then unresolved claims move to open questions)
- [CheckoutTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/CheckoutTests.cs) (the worker reads a clone at the pinned commit).
- Cited lines that resolved: 50 of 50 at the [phase 3 exit](../benchmarks.md#phase-3-exit-one-worker-against-a-plain-session), 99 of 99 at the [phase 4 exit](../benchmarks.md#phase-4-exit-split-against-a-plain-session).

### Split a question into 2 to 4 parallel read-only subtasks

- [SplitTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/SplitTests.cs) (dependency order, fork of the first node, at most 2 at once, deterministic merge).
- [Phase 4 benchmark](../benchmarks.md#phase-4-exit-split-against-a-plain-session): intake split 6 of 6 runs and 99 of 99 citations resolved, but a split cost about 1.53× a plain session ($0.00754 against $0.00492 per run) for a blind score of 0.967 against 0.950.
- It did not pay on those questions ([ADR 0017](../adr/0017-split-runs-forked-siblings-and-merge.md)).

Limits: see [Limits of the rows that work](#limits-of-the-rows-that-work) (Split).

### Approval stops, and the stop actions deny, improve and ask

- [OrchestratorActionTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/OrchestratorActionTests.cs): each stop's status and open questions, the improved request's diff artifact, `strict`'s approval thresholds, `context.approved`, and the fall back to `answer` for an action the preset does not allow.

### OpenCode runtime, pinned to 2.0.18

- [OpenCodeClientTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/OpenCodeClientTests.cs), [OpenCodeSpecContractTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/OpenCodeSpecContractTests.cs) (against the checked-in spec), [OpenCodeServerProcessTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/OpenCodeServerProcessTests.cs) (stand-in binary).
- The phase 3 and 4 benchmarks ran on OpenCode before the pin moved from 2.0.16 to 2.0.18
- the re-pin note records no live worker session on 2.0.18 ([ADR 0004](../adr/0004-opencode-major-and-runtime-adapter.md#re-pinned-to-2018-2026-09-28)).

Limits: see [Limits of the rows that work](#limits-of-the-rows-that-work) (OpenCode 2.0.18).

### Claude Code runtime, pinned to 2.1.283

- [ClaudeCodeRuntimeTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ClaudeCodeRuntimeTests.cs) (stand-in CLI), [ClaudeCodeDefaultsTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ClaudeCodeDefaultsTests.cs).
- [ADR 0020](../adr/0020-claude-code-runtime-adapter.md) records a live run on 2.1.195 whose 6 file references all resolved, and a live two-turn session on 2.1.283
- the API-key mode never ran live.

Limits: see [Limits of the rows that work](#limits-of-the-rows-that-work) (Claude Code API-key mode).

### Runtime selection

The profile's `runtime`, then `CHARGEHAND_RUNTIME`, then the one agent CLI on `PATH`.

- [RuntimeSelectorTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/RuntimeSelectorTests.cs)
- [changelog 0.4.0](../../CHANGELOG.md#040---2026-09-29)
- [ADR 0026](../adr/0026-extension-model.md).

### Presets with per-node token and USD budgets

- [ConfigFileTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ConfigFileTests.cs) (shipped presets validate, deny reading `*.env` files, remove the shell tool)
- [WorkerNodeTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/WorkerNodeTests.cs) (token budget, USD cap, compaction trigger, deadline)
- [ReviewPresetTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ReviewPresetTests.cs).

Limits: see [Limits of the rows that work](#limits-of-the-rows-that-work) (USD caps need prices).

### Drafts for program callers (the `draft` preset)

The `draft` preset takes no repository, and caller inputs are the evidence.

- [DraftTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/DraftTests.cs).
- [Phase 5 exit](../benchmarks.md#content-engines-call-through-the-interface-met): one draft through `chargehand serve` completed for $0.0006 with 4 claims, each citing an input the caller sent.

### Error codes on failed results

- [ResultErrorTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ResultErrorTests.cs), [WorkerNodeTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/WorkerNodeTests.cs), [OpenCodeClientTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/OpenCodeClientTests.cs)
- [ADR 0022](../adr/0022-error-codes-in-result-v1.md).

### Repository roots and worker clones at the pinned commit

- [CheckoutTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/CheckoutTests.cs) (roots, `/`, clone reuse, another commit, uncommitted and ignored files kept out, a tracked denied file refused)
- [ProfileTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ProfileTests.cs) (the launch-directory default)
- [ADR 0023](../adr/0023-repository-roots-and-worker-clones.md), [ADR 0028](../adr/0028-default-repository-roots.md).

### Run log and show

- [RunLogTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/RunLogTests.cs) (a start record without a run record, concurrent writers, a half-written last line)
- [ServerTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ServerTests.cs) checks that a run whose process ended reads as `lost`.
- `show` prints those records
- its output format has no test of its own.

### Reports: cache, reconcile, routes

- [CacheReportTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/CacheReportTests.cs), [ReconcilerTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ReconcilerTests.cs), [RoutingReportTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/RoutingReportTests.cs).
- At the [phase 4 exit](../benchmarks.md#phase-4-exit-split-against-a-plain-session), `chargehand cache` named the instruction entry that stopped siblings from forking.
- [ADR 0012](../adr/0012-observability.md) records 8 of 8 calls joined to gateway spend rows in the v0 benchmark.

### HTTP server with a bearer key

- [ServerTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ServerTests.cs) (key on every route, Host check, refusal to listen beyond loopback without allowed hosts, status codes, events, the bound of 10 unfinished runs).
- [Phase 5 exit](../benchmarks.md#content-engines-call-through-the-interface-met): `samples/ContentEngineCall` sent its draft to `POST /v1/runs`.

### MCP over Streamable HTTP (/v1/mcp)

- [McpTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/McpTests.cs) (the SDK's own client lists `orchestrate` with both schemas and calls it)
- [ADR 0018](../adr/0018-callable-interface-http-mcp-run-store.md) records a live check that ran a draft as a task.

### MCP over stdio, chargehand mcp

- [StdioMcpTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/StdioMcpTests.cs)
- CI packs the tool and runs [mcp-smoke.py](../../scripts/mcp-smoke.py) against it with a stand-in `claude` ([ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)).

### MCP tasks, input_required questions, and the run id before a client timeout

- [McpTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/McpTests.cs), [StdioMcpTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/StdioMcpTests.cs)
- [ADR 0018](../adr/0018-callable-interface-http-mcp-run-store.md), [ADR 0029](../adr/0029-mcp-run-id-before-a-client-timeout.md).

### Server container image

- [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile), [release.yml](../../.github/workflows/release.yml).
- No test or benchmark in this repository runs the image.

What is missing: [Server container image](#server-container-image-1).

### Prompt CI on prompt and preset changes

- [GateTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/GateTests.cs), [PromptCiTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/PromptCiTests.cs), [prompt-ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/prompt-ci.yml).
- [Phase 5 exit](../benchmarks.md#prompt-ci-blocks-a-real-prompt-regression-met-on-a-rerun): both planted regressions passed the first gate
- with a completeness score one of them blocks and the other still passes.

What is missing: [Prompt CI](#prompt-ci).

### Long-term memory from MCP servers

- [GoalSixTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/GoalSixTests.cs) is the goal 0.6 done bar in process: one run recalls from two stacked providers (Hindsight through a gateway, and a Chronicle-shaped one over the SSE transport that answers in both structured content and text, as the real server does), retains only the claim whose citation resolved, and the same run gives a worker a service. A second case stops one provider and checks that the run completes with the other. A third loads the profile example in the [guide page](memory-and-services.md).
- [McpMemoryProviderTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/McpMemoryProviderTests.cs) checks the mapping's recall, retain and invalidate calls against a fake MCP server, including the fields the removed Hindsight HTTP client sent, and a Chronicle-shaped recall; [MemoryConfigTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/MemoryConfigTests.cs) checks that a bad mapping fails when the profile loads and that the old object form fails with the migration.
- [MemoryStackTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/MemoryStackTests.cs) checks recall across several providers at once (labels by source, one line per fact, duplicates, limits, timeouts, every kind of provider failure).
- [MemoryRunTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/MemoryRunTests.cs) and [MemoryFailOpenTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/MemoryFailOpenTests.cs) drive whole runs that recall, retain and survive a failing provider; the caller's own cancellation still stops the run. [RetainableClaimsTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/RetainableClaimsTests.cs) pins which claims are retained.
- [McpConnectionPoolTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/McpConnectionPoolTests.cs) and [SecretTemplateTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/SecretTemplateTests.cs) cover Streamable HTTP, SSE and stdio servers and `{secret:item}`; [ExtensionsCheckTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ExtensionsCheckTests.cs) covers `chargehand extensions check`.
- Live, on 2026-09-29 ([the guide](memory-and-services.md#checked-live)): `extensions check --probe` passed with Hindsight through a gateway and Chronicle over SSE; 20 of 20 recalled ids matched between Hindsight's HTTP API and the gateway's MCP recall; a run with the old object form and one with the list form produced the same chain block hash; the list-form run recalled 10 facts from each provider.
- No benchmark measures what recalled facts do to an answer ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-memory-provider-contract.md)).

What is missing: [Long-term memory](#long-term-memory).

### Services: MCP tools for a preset's workers

- [PresetServicesTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/PresetServicesTests.cs) and [ServiceResolverTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ServiceResolverTests.cs): a preset's `services` names resolve against the server's tool list, and a missing server, secret or tool drops that service and not the run.
- [ServiceRunTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ServiceRunTests.cs): the grant reaches the node, the tools hash changes only when something is granted, and a dropped service is in the run log.
- [ClaudeCodeServicesTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ClaudeCodeServicesTests.cs) (stand-in CLI): a private config file outside the checkout, exactly the granted tools allowed, the file removed when the turn ends. [OpenCodeServicesTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/OpenCodeServicesTests.cs) (recording HTTP handler): the registration lifecycle and the deny-then-allow rules. [GoalSixTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/GoalSixTests.cs) drives a whole run from a preset through a real service resolver into the Claude Code runtime's stand-in CLI.
- [ADR 0034](../adr/0034-memory-and-services-over-mcp.md) records the spike behind the delivery to each runtime and a live check on OpenCode 2.0.19 with a stand-in model.
- Live, on 2026-09-29 ([the guide](memory-and-services.md#checked-live)): on Claude Code 2.1.283 a granted tool of a test server was called and answered, its other tool was absent, and a granted server with a missing command read `failed` and left no config directory; on OpenCode 2.0.19 with a stand-in model a granted tool answered, an ungranted one was unknown, two runs with different grants at one location each saw only their own tool, and a failed server was reported and removed; on OpenCode 2.0.19 with a small model, whole runs called a granted tool and quoted its reply, the ungranted tool was unknown, and no registration was left afterwards.

What is missing: [Services](#services).

### Running with no profile file

- [ProfileTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ProfileTests.cs) (defaults when the file is missing; a placeholder model that no `models` map names is unset, so the runtime uses its own default model).
- [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) marks goal 0.4 done, and the [package README](../../src/Chargehand.Cli/README.package.md) says a profile is optional.

What is missing: [Running with no profile file](#running-with-no-profile-file-1).

### Claude Code plugin, /chargehand:change

- [ChangeSkillTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ChangeSkillTests.cs), [PluginManifestTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/PluginManifestTests.cs), and `claude plugin validate --strict` in [ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
- [change-e2e.sh](../../scripts/change-e2e.sh) is an end-to-end check that [change-e2e.yml](../../.github/workflows/change-e2e.yml) runs on demand
- the repository records no result of it.
- The plugin's MCP entry runs the `Chargehand` package, which is now on nuget.org ([README](../../README.md#claude-code-plugin)).

What is missing: [Claude Code plugin](#claude-code-plugin).

### Chargehand and Chargehand.Contracts on nuget.org

- nuget.org's flat-container index lists `Chargehand` 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 and `Chargehand.Contracts` 1.2.0-alpha (checked on 2026-09-29); [ADR 0027](../adr/0027-dnx-package-and-mcp-registry.md) found neither there on 2026-09-28.
- [release.yml](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) packs and pushes each package whose version is new there, when the repository variable `NUGET_USER` is set.
- [mcp-smoke.py](../../scripts/mcp-smoke.py) packs the tool and starts it from an empty directory in CI ([ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
- [README](../../README.md#from-the-package) has the `dnx` lines.

### Listing in the MCP Registry

- Goal 0.4 in [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) and [ADR 0027](../adr/0027-dnx-package-and-mcp-registry.md).
- [McpServerJsonTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/McpServerJsonTests.cs) validates `.mcp/server.json` against the pinned schema, and pins its name to the repository owner's spelling and to the package README's ownership line.
- The `mcp-registry` job in [release.yml](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) publishes the entry after a release, when `NUGET_USER` is set. It ran for v0.4.1, and no test covers it.
- The registry lists `io.github.Egoushka/chargehand` 0.4.1 (checked on 2026-09-29).
- The `Chargehand` 0.4.0 README has the ownership line in lower case, which the registry does not match to that name, so 0.4.0 is not listed.

### Writing nodes in worktrees

- Goal 0.7 in [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md), [ADR 0035](../adr/0035-sandboxed-writing-workers.md), [Writing a branch](writing.md).
- [ChangeRunTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/ChangeRunTests.cs) drive whole runs on a scripted runtime: green, red then fixed, red for good, no test command, no change, refused without a sandbox, and the source repository and shared checkout untouched.
- [SandboxTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/SandboxTests.cs) run the macOS sandbox for real: a write outside the workspace and a read of a credential directory fail, a connection fails unless the network is allowed.
- On 2026-09-29 `scripts/write-e2e.sh` ran on macOS with the signed-in Claude Code: one failing Python test fixed in one attempt, verified under `sandbox-exec`.
- A split with a writing subtask is still rejected ([SplitTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/SplitTests.cs)).

What is missing: [Writing nodes](#writing-nodes).

### Checking that the cited text supports each claim

- Goal 0.8 in [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md).
- [GitEvidenceResolver.cs](../../src/Chargehand/Verification/GitEvidenceResolver.cs) checks that a cited path and line range exist at the commit, not what the lines say.

What is missing: [Support checking](#support-checking).

## Limits of the rows that work

- **Split.** On the phase 4 questions a split scored 128 per dollar against 193 for a plain session. On cost alone it needs about 1.5× the plain answer's quality to win on quality per dollar, and it reached 1.02×. [ADR 0017](../adr/0017-split-runs-forked-siblings-and-merge.md) concludes that intake should choose `split` only when one session cannot cover the parts.
- **OpenCode 2.0.18.** The contract test passes against the 2.0.18 spec, and [ADR 0030](../adr/0030-default-opencode-server.md) records a hand check that a 2.0.18 server starts and answers `/api/info`. No recorded worker session ran on 2.0.18.
- **Claude Code API-key mode.** The tests cover it with a stand-in CLI; no live run is recorded ([ADR 0020](../adr/0020-claude-code-runtime-adapter.md)).
- **USD caps need prices.** A model with no entry in the profile's `prices` has an unknown cost: `usage.usd` may be `null`, and its USD cap cannot fire. The per-node token budgets still apply.

## What is missing

### Server container image

A tag `v<Version>` builds and pushes `ghcr.io/<owner>/chargehand:<Version>` after [release.yml](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) checks the tag against `Directory.Build.props` and the changelog. Nothing in the repository starts that image and sends it a request. The image carries the Claude Code runtime only; an OpenCode profile points `opencode.url` at a server that runs next to the container ([ADR 0024](../adr/0024-server-on-a-private-network-and-release-images.md)). The [0.2.1 fix](../../CHANGELOG.md#021---2026-09-28) covers that setup: a worker clone across a container's repository mount and its work volume.

### Prompt CI

The gate runs and posts its status, and its coverage has holes:

- Its first score measured grounding, which the worker node already enforces at run time, so both planted regressions passed. A completeness factor now blocks the first (#5) on a rerun. The second (#6) kept its claim count and still passes.
- By a replay of logged runs, the score catches a thinning of #5's size in at most about 86% of reruns at 12 items ([ADR 0019](../adr/0019-prompt-ci-and-routing-report.md)).
- The prompt blocks and preset files of `default`, `thorough` and `strict` have no eval cell; a change to them fails the gate unless the owner passes `--allow-uncovered`.
- `evals/cells.json` on main defines a `review/worker` cell; `docs/benchmarks.md` records no calibration run for it.

[Prompt CI](prompt-ci.md) has the numbers.

### Long-term memory

With the profile's `memory` list set, a run recalls facts once and adds them to each node's prompt as context the worker is told to check in the repository and never cite. Each fact carries the name of the memory it came from, and `chargehand show` prints what each memory recalled and retained. A failed recall leaves the run without that memory's facts, and retain stays off by default ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-memory-provider-contract.md)). With retain on, a run stores only the claims that cite a `file` or `commit` that resolved at the run's commit, each with its locators, the repository and the commit, and never the request text or the summary; a run without a repository retains nothing ([ADR 0034](../adr/0034-memory-and-services-over-mcp.md)). The Hindsight HTTP client and the single-object form are gone; a profile that still has the object fails to load with a migration message.

A retain against a real Hindsight, read back and invalidated, is recorded on the guide page (its recall dropped the item's commit and locators; the document keeps them). What no test or recorded run covers: what recalled facts do to an answer. `chargehand extensions check` reports a mapping that does not fit a server's tools before a run does. The guide page lists the [live checks still to run](memory-and-services.md#checked-live).

### Services

A preset's `services` give workers read-only tools from MCP servers in the profile, on Claude Code and on OpenCode. No shipped preset lists any. What is missing: no recorded run has a claim citing a URL a service returned (the test server returns none); a live OpenCode run with a small model called a granted tool and answered from it. On OpenCode, a preset that denies `*` (such as `draft`) cannot use services, because workers reach a server through OpenCode's `execute` tool; and a claim that rests on a service's output cites a URL it returned, which the resolver accepts as seen in tool output and does not check against the claim (goal 0.8).

### Running with no profile file

`Profile.Load` returns defaults when the file is missing, and a placeholder model that the shipped presets name (`provider/worker-model`, `provider/small-model`, `provider/critic-model`) and no `models` map names is unset, so the runtime uses its own default model. Goal 0.4 ends when a clean machine with one signed-in agent CLI gets an answer with resolved evidence and no profile file ([ADR 0026](../adr/0026-extension-model.md)), and [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) marks it done. The tests call no model, so that end-to-end case has no test of its own.

### Claude Code plugin

`/plugin install` works through the marketplace entry, and the plugin's MCP entry runs `dotnet dnx Chargehand@<version> --yes -- mcp` ([.mcp.json](../../plugins/chargehand/.mcp.json)), where [PluginManifestTests](../../tests/Chargehand.Tests/PluginManifestTests.cs) pins `<version>` to `Directory.Build.props`. That package is now on nuget.org ([The change command](change.md)). What remains is goal 0.5 in [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md): the command is its first piece.

### Writing nodes

The `code` preset writes; every other shipped preset denies edits. Not covered: the worker can edit the tests the command runs (listed in the verification artifact, not blocked); the Linux sandbox (`bwrap`) has been tested as arguments, never run; the only real-model run is one small Python case; a preset cannot split into writing subtasks; a build that restores packages needs `sandbox.network`. Merging stays a person's step ([ADR 0035](../adr/0035-sandboxed-writing-workers.md)).

### Support checking

The resolver still only confirms that a citation points at something real. Since 0.8.0, a model then judges whether the cited text supports each claim ([Support checking and signed results](support-and-signing.md)); on 30 labelled claims two Claude models agreed with the labels 25 times, perfectly on clearly supported and clearly unsupported claims and not on partly supported ones. It is a model's opinion, not a proof, and it does not cover claims that cite only a URL, a commit or a session message.
